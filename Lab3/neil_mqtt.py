"""
This file is primarily the same as the one downloaded from Bruinlearn. The modifications made are for the ping-ponging
of messages where the on_message function is modified so that it immedietely sends a response back if it receives a message
from a specific topic and then increments the counter. In the while loop at the bottom an initial message is sent as this 
client is the one that starts the ping-pong. This can be further expanded to accomedate different users/devices by assigning 
them their own personal identifier through the topic string and performing various commands accordingly.
